# Grama Skeleton for Grav


Skelgrama is a skeleton for [the grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) using the [grama](https://framagit.org/squeak/grama) theme. It allows you to create easily a website and blog that you can edit from markdown files or with the grav administrative interface.

The grama theme goal is to provide a simple multilingual website. It makes it easy to create a website with a few pages, a blog posts section, some events cards in a blogging style, a basic wiki...

This skeleton and theme don't include by default reference to any social network, analytics scripts, or any GAFAM+ fonts or libraries. This a design choice to enhance site owners/visitors privacy. You may add any of those elements on your website by yourself, but please don't ask me to include them by default, since I designed this theme with the explicit goal not to have those elements baked in a site.

## Credits

Skelgrama is of any use only thanks to [the grav CMS](https://getgrav.org) which makes 99% of the work of making your website run, in fact.
Some stuff are made much easier by the following amazing javascript libraries: [jquery](https://jquery.com/) and [underscorejs](https://underscorejs.org/).
The intro and typography page are adapted from the skeleton installed by default by grav.
The skeleton logo is based on the grav logo.
